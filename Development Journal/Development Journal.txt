SMART TRAFFIC MODEL(SMT)--DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
Week #1:
	Wednesday--February 4, 2015:
		Today I started drafting different traffic scenarios for different traffic light patterns. 				These scenarios will help me test my SMT and see if there has been ay improvement. The scenarios 			will also be displayed with my live demonstration, and I will compare them to the original 				stoplight designm by measuring time from Point A to Point B, the number of cars passing through the 		light, the number of wrecks, and the amount of fuel used during the commute. I also started 
		researching intersection related accidents and current stoplight operations. I found out there has
		been an idea developing in Houston, Texas that is similair to my SMT. However, the plan is only in
		it's first stage (pilot), and hasn't been fully developed. Their algorithim is ran off of a Linux
		based computer and operates off of real time, taking data from nearby smartphones. Siemens also 
		plans on installing a GPS radio devices for first responders(i.e. ambulances and police officers)
		that will turn an upcoming stoplight green. Siemens also plans to implant an "IntelliDrive" concept	
		that will send real-time data between vehicles and traffic ligts, alerting the driver that there is 		a stop ahead. In my research in stop light operation, I learned that there are many ways a 				stoplight changes. Some lights don't have any detectors. Rather, they simply operate on timers. The			detectors in a some stoplights vary from lasers to rubber hoses filled with air. However, the most			common method to detect cars is the inductive loop. An inductve loop is a coil of wire implanted			in the road's surface. When the car rolls over these rectangular-shaped deformities in the road,			the light is alerted that you are there, and may change green for you.

Week #2:
	Monday--February 9, 2015
		Today I continued drafting different traffic scenarios for different traffic light patterns. See
		Wednesday, February 4, 2015 for details. I also updated my README for the Smart-Traffic-Model 
		repository to contain a more descriptive description than "This is a great project!". I've also 
		started brainstorming the outline of my code and thinking about how the code will work. Lastly
		today, I decided to continue to familiarize myself with GitHub by navigating around and researching
		websites that can possibly help me with understanding GitHub a little better. I'm starting to 
		understand some of the basics of GitHub now. I unfortunately had trouble uploading what I have done	
		to GitHub as I experienced some problems in GitBash. I'll look into that further when I get the 
		chance.
	
	Tuesday--February 10, 2015
		Sadly, I was unable to work on the Smart Traffic Model.
	
	Wednesday--February 11, 2015
		Today I created a class named Tester to remind me to create a Tester class that will test my Smart
		Traffic Model. I haven't started to develop it yet, as I don't really have anything in my Smart
		Traffic Model class that needs to be tested. I also decided to work on an API with the methods that			clearly outlines what I need to work on instead of shooting in the dark. The API will also contain 	
		bits of the Proposal. Since I referece the Proposal quite often, I thought it would be a good idea	
		to stuff some of the Proposal in with the API so I don't have to switch between two Word Documents.
		I also continued drafting different traffic scenarios for differnt traffic light patterns. The 
		scenarios are currently on graph paper, although I may decide to see if I can transfer them on the 	
		computer if I have time, or if necessary. Still had trouble trying to update my updates to the 
		GitHub website. Hopefully figureing out that problem tomorrow. I also learned that you can import	
		java.util.Timer. This should be extremely helpful in my project when calculating the commuting time
