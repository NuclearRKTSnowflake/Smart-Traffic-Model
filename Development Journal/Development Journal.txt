SMART TRAFFIC MODEL(SMT)--DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
Week #1:
	Wednesday--February 4, 2015:
		Today I started drafting different traffic scenarios for different traffic light patterns. 				These scenarios will help me test my SMT and see if there has been ay improvement. The scenarios 			will also be displayed with my live demonstration, and I will compare them to the original 				stoplight designm by measuring time from Point A to Point B, the number of cars passing through the 		light, the number of wrecks, and the amount of fuel used during the commute. I also started 
		researching intersection related accidents and current stoplight operations. I found out there has
		been an idea developing in Houston, Texas that is similair to my SMT. However, the plan is only in
		it's first stage (pilot), and hasn't been fully developed. Their algorithim is ran off of a Linux
		based computer and operates off of real time, taking data from nearby smartphones. Siemens also 
		plans on installing a GPS radio devices for first responders(i.e. ambulances and police officers)
		that will turn an upcoming stoplight green. Siemens also plans to implant an "IntelliDrive" concept	
		that will send real-time data between vehicles and traffic ligts, alerting the driver that there is 		a stop ahead. In my research in stop light operation, I learned that there are many ways a 				stoplight changes. Some lights don't have any detectors. Rather, they simply operate on timers. The			detectors in a some stoplights vary from lasers to rubber hoses filled with air. However, the most			common method to detect cars is the inductive loop. An inductve loop is a coil of wire implanted			in the road's surface. When the car rolls over these rectangular-shaped deformities in the road,			the light is alerted that you are there, and may change green for you.
