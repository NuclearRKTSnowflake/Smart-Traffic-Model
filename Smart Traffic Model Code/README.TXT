NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES/ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stoplights are an essential part of our transportation infrastructure.
They strive to maximize intersection safety and efficiency for both vehicles and pedestrians. 
However, the lack of a predictive ability can cause stoplights to have negative effects on traffic flow.  
Stoplights that operate with a timing apparatus or vehicle sensor lack the ability to react to dynamic traffic situations.   
These drawbacks can cause driver frustration and compromise vehicle and pedestrian safety.   
The Smart Traffic Model (STM) is an algorithm that employs predictive modeling to traffic flow.  
This model is intended to be employed with stoplight to vehicle communication infrastructure that is predicted to be widely adopted in the near future.
The Smart Traffic Model will:
1.	Increase traffic flow.
2.	Decrease fuel usage.
3.	Increase safety.
4.	Decrease commuting time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUDIENCE/CLIENTS/USERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Smart Traffic Model will directly benefit drivers and benefit pedestrians. 
With the Smart Traffic Model, drivers should find themselves less frustrated with poor stoplight timing. 
Drivers should also notice an improvement in their commuting time and fuel usage. 
On the macroscopic scale, the reduced amount of fuel usage and commuting time will benefit consumers and the economy. 
The reduction of emissions will additionally help in the abatement of city smog considerably.

TIMELINE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
February 6 Deliverables:
1. Draft scenarios for different traffic patterns.
2. Research intersection related accidents.
3. Research current stoplightoperation.

March 6 Deliverables:
1. Create simulations of commuting time, accident probabilities, traffic flow, and fuel usage for current stoplight operation.

April 3 Deliverables:
1. Code an algorithm for predictive stoplight communcication.
2. Apply algorithm to traffic flow simulations developed for March 6th deliverables.

May 1 Deliverables:
1. Measure improvements in commuting time and cost of gas used from current stoplight operation to STM operation.
2. Compare improvements in measured areas.
3. Include results in final report.

PRODUCT/LIVE DEMONSTRATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Smart Traffic Model is a software program that would alter traffic light patterns through application of a predictive algorithm to achieve the stated objectives. 
This will be demonstrated on a 25X25 grid displaying different traffic simulations and comparing them to the original stoplight design by measuring:
1. Commuting time from Point A to Point B.
2. The cost of gas used to get from Point A to Point B.

REALITY CHECK
------------------------------------------------------------------------
No funding is neededfor equipment in order to complete this project.
All tasks will be completed with computing resources previously acquired.
Using Java BlueJ.

CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Smart Traffic Model aims to help drivers improve their commuting time and improve their gas mileage/fuel usage.
It also strives to create a safer environment on the roads, decreasing the amount of wrecks and increasing the amount of traffic flow though intersections.
